Similarities is a program that compares two files for similarities 
and then highlights similar parts in two files with Flask app.

This program should compare files in 3 ways: line by line, sentence by sentence 
and by substrings of n length.

I had some distribution code for this task but I fully implemented following things:

- lines in helpers.py;
- sentences in helpers.py;
- substrings in helpers.py;
- index.html in templates subfolder.
